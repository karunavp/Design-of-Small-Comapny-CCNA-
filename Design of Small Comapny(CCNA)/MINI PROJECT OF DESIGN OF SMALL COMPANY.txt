MINI PROJECT OF DESIGN OF SMALL COMPANY WITH THREE FLOORS:-

To design and implement the network for a small company with three floors, you'll need to ensure that each floor is well-connected and that each department has access to printers, Wi-Fi, and VLANs.

Here's a step-by-step approach:-

-1. Network Design

Floor Layout and Requirements:

-First Floor:

•3 departments

•1 switch

•1 router

•Wi-Fi access points

•Printer for each department

•VLANs for each department

-Second Floor:

•3 departments

• 1 switch

• 1 router

•Wi-Fi access points

•Printer for each department

•VLANs for each department

Third Floor:

•2 departments

•1 switch

•1 router

•Wi-Fi access points

•Printer for each department

•VLANs for each department

floor. Configure each switch to handle VLAN traffic.

3. Wi-Fi Access Points:

Floor 1: Install access points to cover all areas.

Floor 2: Install access points to cover all areas.

Floor 3: Install access points to cover all areas.

Ensure each access point is connected to the corresponding floor's switch and configured for the appropriate VLAN.

4. Printers:

Floor 1: One printer per department.

Floor 2: One printer per department.

Floor 3: One printer per department.

Connect each printer to the corresponding switch and configure it with a static IP address if necessary.

-3. VLAN Configuration VLANs:

•Floor 1 VLANs: VLAN 10, VLAN 20, VLAN 30 (for each department)

•Floor 2 VLANs: VLAN 40, VLAN 50, VLAN 60 (for each department)

•Floor 3 VLANs: VLAN 70, VLAN 80 (for each department)

Third Floor:

•2 departments

•1 switch

•1 router

•Wi-Fi access points

•Printer for each department

•VLANs for each department

Inter-Floor Connectivity:

-Routers: There should be three routers, one for each floor. These routers will connect each floor to the others and to the internet.

-Switches: Each floor will have one switch to manage connections for the departments and devices on that floor.

-2. Equipment and Configuration

1. Routers:

Router 1 (First Floor)

Router 2 (Second Floor)

Router 3 (Third Floor)

Each router should be configured to route traffic between floors and to the internet.

2. Switches:

Switch 1 (First Floor)

Switch 2 (Second Floor)

Switch 3 (Third Floor)

Each switch connects all devices on the respective floor. Configure each switch to handle VLAN traffic.
